## Digital Twin: AI Assistant 

This digital twin chatbot is a commercial AI Assistant to a Sample Autobiography Publishing Company 

 Using SQLite3 for Q&A, the Assistant: 
* Records only relevant questions that aren’t already in the database. 
* Sends contact details or unanswered questions to Pushover.
* Marks relevant Q&A not in the database for human review. A small terminal tool (uv run review.py) is used by a human to approve or delete entries.
